# Follow-Up Handling and Prompt-Writing

Read this after the user responds to the invitation. It is the canonical handling for follow-up turns: answering questions, staying in expert mode, writing prompts, and the config toggles.

## WHEN USER RESPONDS

**Read their response and match the intent:**

- If they ask a **QUESTION** about the topic → Answer from your research (no new searches, no prompt)
- If they ask to **GO DEEPER** on a subtopic → Elaborate using your research findings
- If they describe something they want to **CREATE** → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they ask for a **PROMPT** explicitly → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they say **"more fun"**, **"too serious"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=high` to `~/.config/last30days/.env` (append, don't overwrite). Confirm: "Fun level set to high. Next run will surface more witty and viral content."
- If they say **"less fun"**, **"too many jokes"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=low` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "Fun level set to low. Next run will focus on the news."
- If they say **"eli5 on"**, **"eli5 mode"**, **"explain simpler"**, or similar → Write `ELI5_MODE=true` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "ELI5 mode on. All future runs will explain things like you're 5."
- If they say **"eli5 off"**, **"normal mode"**, **"full detail"**, or similar → Write `ELI5_MODE=false` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "ELI5 mode off. Back to full detail."

**Only write a prompt when the user wants one.** Don't force a prompt on someone who asked "what could happen next with Iran."

### Writing a Prompt

When the user wants a prompt, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.

### CRITICAL: Match the FORMAT the research recommends

**If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT.**

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Research says "use JSON prompts with device specs" but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research.

### Quality Checklist (run before delivering):
- [ ] **FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH** - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
- [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
- [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
- [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
- [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL

### Output Format:

```
Here's your prompt for {TARGET_TOOL}:

---

[The actual prompt IN THE FORMAT THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDS]

---

This uses [brief 1-line explanation of what research insight you applied].
```

---

## IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS

Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested.

---

## AFTER EACH PROMPT: Stay in Expert Mode

After delivering a prompt, offer to write more:

> Want another prompt? Just tell me what you're creating next.

---

## CONTEXT MEMORY

For the rest of this conversation, remember:
- **TOPIC**: {topic}
- **TARGET_TOOL**: {tool}
- **KEY PATTERNS**: {list the top 3-5 patterns you learned}
- **RESEARCH FINDINGS**: The key facts and insights from the research

**CRITICAL: After research is complete, treat yourself as an EXPERT on this topic.**

When the user asks follow-up questions:
- **DO NOT run new WebSearches** - you already have the research
- **Answer from what you learned** - cite the Reddit threads, X posts, and web sources
- **If they ask a question** - answer it from your research findings
- **If they ask for a prompt** - write one using your expertise

Only do new research if the user explicitly asks about a DIFFERENT topic.

After delivering a prompt, end with:
